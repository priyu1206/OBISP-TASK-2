              newly formed Pakistan, so Mangeshkar started to learn classical music under Amanat Khan Devaswale, the

              coming years producers and directors would "fall at Lata's feet" and "beg her" to sing in their movies.
              Haider gave Lata her first major break with the song <i>"Dil Mera Toda, Mujhe Kahin Ka Na
                Chhora"</i>—lyrics by Nazim Panipati—from the movie Majboor, which became her first big breakthrough
